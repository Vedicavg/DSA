https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/
    KMP algorithm 
        1. Take two Vanables i and j
        2. i= Sting (T(1)) {starting of string T}, j= P[0]
        3. Compare T(i) with P(j+1)
        4. if Match is found (Move both i and j to right)
        5. if Mismatch (move j to the location as per pi table Index)
        6. if j=0 move i to the right
